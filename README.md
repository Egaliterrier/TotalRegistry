# Total Registry

Replacement for the Windows built-in *Regedit.exe* tool. Improvements over that tool include:

* Show real Registry (not just the standard one)
* Sort list view by any column
* Key icons for hives, inaccessible keys, and links
* Key details: last write time and number of keys/values
* Displays MUI and REG_EXPAND_SZ expanded values
* Full search (Find All / Ctrl+Shift+F)
* Enhanced hex editor for binary values
* Undo/redo
* Copy/paste of keys/values
* Optionally replace RegEdit
* Connect to remote Registry
* View open key handles

## Build instructions

Build the solution file with Visual Studio 2022. Can be built with Visual Studio 2019 as well (change toolset to v142 and C++ compiler version to C++ latest or C++20).
